    S "Heh, it dis at first, but that's not the most gruesome way she died."
    S "So, as I was saying, I head home, think about all the way I could have saved her, and cry myself to sleep."
    S "I have some weird nightmares about who I failed and it's my fault, weird vision or a tunnel or something, like purgatory stuff."
    K "And then, out of nowhere,"
    S "Alice wakes me up and start yapping about going to the party because she want to see the fireworks."
    K "... Okay; so you saw Alice die in front of you, and the world restarted, just like me yesterday. That's fucked."
    R "Y̷o̸u̵ ̶f̷i̵n̴a̴l̵l̶y̶ ̶g̷e̸t̸ ̸i̶t̴.̶ ̵"
    S "Yeah, pieced it together ? The world restarts when she dies, and she inevitably dies, everytime, no matter what I do."
    K "Oh shit man that's really fucked up."
    S "Yeah... Sorry I got a bit excited earlier, but you know how alone I felt all along."
    S "Everyone keeps saying the same shit, over and over again, I've seen everything, tried everything, I make the same mistakes I've made hundreds of times,"
    S "nothing fucking works, the same repetitive bullshit ALL DAY and at the end Alice is covered in blood and dies."
    K "..."
    S "Sorry. But you know it's good to finally have someone react differently to what I say, who will actually remenber when it restarts."
    K "I'm sorry to ask you this but have you tried everything ? Isn't there more you can do, now that there two of us ?"
    K "You can't just give up, that doesn't make sense, at all !"
    S "What the point ? We save her for a few months, down the road the trips on a fucking rock, she dies and it starts over."
